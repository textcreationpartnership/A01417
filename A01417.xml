            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing that an Element is the leaste portion of the thing whiche it ordayneth, neyther is that same it which is s√©ene in d√©ede, very small, it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlye appeareth, that the sense is not a Iudge of them whiche be the very Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, according to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery thing. Therefore w√©e with <hi>Hipp.</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing those which be firste in the iudgement of sense, and moste simple, will enquire for those, whiche are in d√©ede Elementes of mans life, and whiche can not b√©e dissolued into other: and bo no lesse necessarye to cure sicknesses, then those whiche to the sense s√©eme suche: that is, whether it be one truely in kinde, or els more, and vnlike. If so be, that they be not onely one, but moe, and diuers Elementes, w√©e muste s√©eke againe how many they be, as what, and of what sort, and what fellowship they haue together. Therefore, that the first Element, of which both our bodyes, and also the bodies of all other doo consiste, is not one, eyther in fourme or power, <hi>Hipp.</hi> teacheth by this reason.</p>
            <p>If a man were one thing, he shoulde not be gr√©eued, and if so be he were gr√©eued, it shoulde require one and onely medicine, comprising wel and briefly the summe of the mater. For if a man were one thing that is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of one Element, there shoulde be nothing, through whiche he should f√©ele payne.</p>
            <p>If so be that he were afflicted with any griefe, there were but one waye, and one medicine to cure him. For when as he coulde not be hurte through any outwarde
<pb facs="tcp:27230:6"/> cause, it ought necessarily to suffer inwardly of his own nature. And when as there is one onely nature of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, there shalbe one affecte, and the waye to returne to the naturall state, shalbe one: whiche is a verye ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, seeing there be infinite kindes, as well of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, as of remedyes. By the same reason also you may reprooue the reasons of them, whiche haue brought in, that <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¶</desc>
               </gap>tes without all qualitie, and alteration, and also bodyes vnmade, to be the beginning of all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For a man shoulde not be gr√©eued, if his nature were such, s√©eing that it is necessary, that it which gr√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, shoulde be a receyuer both of sense and alteration.</p>
            <p>If so be, that it be without all alteration, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye k√©epe the same state, whiche it had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. And nowe if it be chaunged, and yet there be not in it naturall power of f√©eling, it can nothing more f√©ele the affections; then stoanes doo f√©ele.</p>
            <p>Therefore, s√©eing that bothe these are required in these chaungings, and in bodyes truely, if w√©e did grow eyther of them, or any suche like, or vnifourme nature, w√©e shoulde not be gr√©eued. Therefore w√©e truely are not made of any vnifourme, or simple substance. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, s√©eing there be two instrumentes, by whiche all opinions be founde out, that is, reason, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Neither of these wil so serue them, that they shal finde any thing made of them, whiche are altogether impatible or vnsufferable, and without sense, whiche after wil be suffering and partaker of feeling. Nay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, although al those motes had an ingraffed sense, and were impatible, and not able to be pierced, so that of the onely mutuall ioyning of them, the fleshe it selfe should be engendred. Neuerthelesse, w√©e shoulde not f√©ele a n√©edle impacte, or pricte any more, then when wee sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the fingers ioyned therewith. Therfore it resteth, that a f√©eling bodye shoulde eyther be of those, whiche likewise haue force to f√©ele and suffer, or of those whiche
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27230:6"/> can suffer, but after haue no sense</p>
            <p>And w√©e will weigh anone whether of these is true: If therefore an Elemente cannot be impatible, it also shal not be one in kinde. If so be, that which is one, is alwaye vnsufferable, s√©eing there is nothing left, into which it may be chaunged, or of which it may suffer, for whatsoeuer is chaunged, is chaunged into an other, and that which suffereth, suffereth through an other. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, s√©eing it is nowe prooued, that there be many Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, let vs enquire for the number of them: yet first let vs distinguish the sectes of them, whiche vniuersally dispute of Elementes: for they are brought into foure. The firste of whiche, is that whiche he pronounceth to consiste of thinges voyde of sense, and also vnsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The other whiche consisteth of thinges indewed with sense, but yet vnsufferable: whiche be subiecte to alteration. Both which in this doe agr√©e, that they both stande of thinges vnsufferable. Wherfore, s√©eing they teache them to be vnpossible, let vs let them passe.</p>
            <p>There be therefore behinde two: the one, whiche constituteth a f√©eling bodye, of the firste Elementes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing facultie both of suffering and f√©eling: An other of thinges suffering, but without sense, both agreeing, that they consist of thinges sufferable: betw√©ene eyther of whiche sectes, what possible thing doth it contayne. For if you wil trye, and examine by reason the partes, those whiche be of bodyes, hauing power of f√©eling. If so be, that you shall trye the first elementes, it may easily be, that although they be sayd to haue no sense, so that they can mutually, and manyfoldely doe, and suffer vppon them selues, some bodye endewed with sense, maye be engendred thereof, many particular alterations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betw√©ene. For as oft as any thing is made of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, if those thinges whiche come into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, suche as they be, shall oure such vnto the ende, that shal neuer attayne any new or purchased fourme,
<pb facs="tcp:27230:7"/> whiche was not before in those thinges of which it was made. But if they many wayes be varied, chaunged, and mingled, then there maye something arise in the thing compounded, whiche may be of an other kinde, to those whiche were founde in the firste Elementes of it. Wherefore, they that will haue a body to be engendred of Fire, Ayre. Water, and Earthe mutually chaunged, and altered, and brought to a certaine temperature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a sensitiue facultie, they doe pronounce thinges agr√©eable vnto truthe.</p>
            <p>But they whiche pronounce of them remaining, as they be, and mingled onely, as Wheate, and Barley, and Beanes are in an heape, they truely doe followe those thinges, whiche can not be done.</p>
            <p>By these therefore it is shewed, that Elementes are moe then one, and also that they can suffer, which <hi>Hipp.</hi> confirming, saith: Howe, I pray you, can it be, that any thing, may of one thing be compounded; s√©eing of many thinges it can not, except they be well tempered. But whether sensible bodyes doe consiste of the firste Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, in all the whiche there is force of f√©eling, or of those rather whiche doe wante them, it is not yet she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that many doo lacke sense, it is thence euidente, that some of the compounde be suche. This therefore is a foolishe opinion, as well of the naturall Philosophers, as of the Phisitions, whiche doo affirme, that there is one Element of man, or of all thinges vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal. For <hi>Thales, Anaximenus, Anaximandes,</hi> &amp; with them <hi>Heraclitus</hi> doe endeuour to shewe, because of the mutuall alteration of Elementes, they s√©e all thinges to growe out of kinde, into other that be n√©ere them, euery one of them to be an vniuersall Elemente: yet so that one appoynteth one thing, an other, an other. All the whiche doe s√©eme to m√©e, to haue dreamed of that firste mater subiect to all Elementes, whiche they sawe to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27230:7"/> one: so also they suppose an Element to be one. But they whiche pronounce all thinges to be one thing, do<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> destroye the beginning of natural Philosophie, and also of Phisicke, and therefore against them w√©e muste not dispute. And this is contrarye to all reason, if because there is seene none of the foure Elementes in the body, pure and sincere, a man woulde denye, that they all are not founde in a man. For why, will you in the bodyes of liuing creatures, finde earth, for example, vnmingled and pure, s√©eing in the whole, suche cannot be shewed of them: for what soeuer parte of it you shal take, that wil be partaker of suche heate, or humour, and ayre sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, yet that earth which w√©e suppose to be an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is moste thicke, heary, and besides that, colde and drye. If so be, that thou shalt in all the world, shewe me a stoane, an earthy body, truely, I will shewe thee in the bodyes of liuing creatures, some thinges like vnto it, that is, the kinde of boanes, the heares, the gristles, and stoanes. S√©eke not therefore in the bodyes of liuing creatures, any thing vnmingled, s√©eing you shall not finde that in the whole worlde, without counterfeiting. But as often as you shall s√©e any colde parte drye, and thickie, let it he ynough to call into thy memory, earth, and let it be ynough to behold any moyste thing, thinne and flowing, to conceiue in thy minde water. Also the heate of the liuing creature. Let it present vnto th√©e Fire, and also the nature of the breath, without the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a liuing body cannot consist, let it bring to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory firste Ayre, then Fire.</p>
            <p>Neither can you denye, that all fruictes are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the earth, and of the water, s√©eing of them they may s√©eme to haue their beginning, &amp; that they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Fire, and Ayre tempered vniuersally.</p>
            <p>Hence you maye gather, that if you macerate, or st√©epe earth in water, you shal make it nothing but clay, and fruictes be not claye. If therefore fruictes doo take
<pb facs="tcp:27230:8"/> their beginning of the vniuersalitie of Elementes, there is not, why you shoulde doubt of liuing creatures, but that of them they may be nourished.</p>
            <p>Therefore, boldly it is to be professed, that Fire, Water, Ayre, and Earthe, to be the firste, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and moste simple Elementes, and beginniners of all thinges, of whiche verily, both Plantes, and also all liuing creatures, are engendred, nourished, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for in them alone you shall finde the chiefest quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without any mingling, or temperature.</p>
            <p>In Earth, especially colde and drithe, in Fire espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, heate and drithe. In the other, the other qualities, according as euery ones nature dothe require. But to est√©eme any Element to be especially moyste, and also to suppose that to be some thing diuers from water, is a pointe of extreme foolishnesse.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that the especiall heate is simpler then Fire, and that by it added to the mater, the Fire is engendred, it is confessed of all Philosophers, whiche truely dooe confesse vniuersally, that a certaine mater without qualitie, (which is subiecte to all Elementes) and also an especiall heate, which is produced in it, is to Fire the beginning of generation, and also that the mater it selfe, is fr√©e from all generation, &amp; corruption: and the qualitie to be that, whiche in it is bothe engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and perisheth. But an Element in that dothe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from a beginning, that beginnes, shoulde be in the same kinde with those, whose beginninges they be, and Elementes doo alwayes appertayne to the same kinde, for a simple qualitie, is the Elemente of a compounde qualitie, and a simple bodye, of a compounde bodye. S√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, hote, moyste, colde, and drye may be thr√©e wayes saide, that is, either as a qualitie, or els, as an vnmingled bodye, or as that whiche is mingled, and the qualitie not s√©eme to be an Element, nor yet a mingled or temperate bodye.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:27230:8"/>
            <p>It is too common, that w√©e saye, an Elemente to be that bodye, whiche is without mingling and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and also simple of qualitie. Wherefore, at the length we are come necessarily to Fire, Ayre, Water, Earth, in whom firste there is especiall heate, especiall colde, especiall moysture, especiall drithe. Which Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes altogether, or some one alone, we doo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse as water, daylye when w√©e doo drinke, or be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, Ayre, whiche doth enuiron vs, while w√©e drawe it in by breathing, Fire also, when w√©e are colde, wee vse that w√©e may be hote.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, liuing creatures, which eate, eyther sande, earth, stoanes, clay, yea, or boanes, doo plentifully bring earth into their bodyes. Wherfore, I truely doo not s√©e; why many men doo saye, that neyther Fire, nor Water, nor Ayre, or Earth be taken away, or added to our bodyes, and therfore that they be not Elementes of our bodyes.</p>
            <p>If so be, that any doo therfore thinke, that we do not shewe in our bodyes any Element, because no man is so heated, that he burneth, or drinketh vntil he be burst, they doo not vnderstand, that if one Element doo perishe, the liuing creature likewise perisheth. And the old Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall perish, if it be turned: the hote, if it be ouer cooled: the moyste, if it greatly waxe drye: the drye, if it more then m√©ete is, be moystened, Whereupon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stƒÅdeth otherwise then they think: for alwaies there is eyther some Element added to the body, or els taken away, that which must be moderately done of them that will the liuing creature to be kept sounde: If so be, that immoderate vse of Elements br√©edeth to death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, s√©eing no qualitie can be founde aparte from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces, w√©e are compelled to receyue them together with the substaunces, and so to geue them to the bodies, which made them: whiche if they require them especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, w√©e minister the Elemente it selfe. I saye, Fire,
<pb facs="tcp:27230:9"/> Ayre, Water, Earth. But when a meane qualitie is necessary, we vse a medicine mingled of the Elements, and sometime of a nourishment. Neyther is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at any time profitable, as a medicine, but when the body n√©edeth an especiall qualitye. And that <hi>Hipp.</hi> by the name of qualitye doeth vnderstande often times a bodye endued with an especiall qualitye: we maye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this saying. If so be where be saieth, when a man dyeth, it is necessarye that euerye part returne to his owne nature, the drye to the drye, the moiste to the moiste, the hote to the hote, the coulde to the coulde. He calleth drye moyste, hote and coulde, not onely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but also substaunces, in which those qualityes are founde: for those they be whiche the Creature being deade, doe departe, and are mingled to the Elements of vniuersalitye.</p>
            <p>But wee will saye that the qualityes, the Creature being dead, do dye, but not to returne to theyr owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore there is not why any man any more shoulde goe about to perswade that h√©e supposeth liuing Creatures to b√©e begotten of qualities, which can not consist a parte from the bodyes, but of bodies in which those especiall qualityes b√©e, for they are common Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of all. And those which for any excellencye of these are called Whote, Colde, moyste or dry, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to euery one.</p>
            <p>A man therfore consisteth of most simple and sensible Elementes, which are called similar, or simple, or lyke. And they againe of the sowre humors, which also doe take their beginnings of things to be eaten and dronke. But these are engendred of Fire, Ayre, Water, and Earth, which truely be constituted of no body any more, but of mater and qualities onely, which we graunt to be the beginnings of them, but not at all the Element: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the Element hath of the qualities that he is an Element.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:27230:9"/>
            <p>If so be that especiall heate be added, that whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wilbe Fire, and so we must saye of the other thr√©e qualityes. And of none other qualitie, but of these fowre an Element is iudged.</p>
            <p>But of the proper Elements of Creatures, that is, of humors we must intreate in the next c≈çmentaries, for of that the similar parts are engendred. These agayne m√©eting together, that first most simple instrument is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, which for the great function or office of one, is by nature prouduced, then when these are framed together another greater instrument is made, &amp; then the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the whole body. Therfore that we may repete the whole disputacion, if we be gr√©eued, our substaunce shal not be one in kinde, nor yet vnsufferable. But w√©e he gr√©eued, therefore it shal not be one in kinde, nor suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Againe, if it suffer, it behoued that it heated, cooled, moistened, or dried, should suffer, s√©eing those which be next cannot by any other meanes be altered. Whole by whole, wherfore it is euident that heate, cold, moisture, &amp; drines, doe constitute or frame the substaunce of euery thing. But how those which are mingled may be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the whole by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole, whether by the only quality, (as <hi>Arist.</hi> supposeth) or whether the substances, they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually entering into them selues, it is not n√©edefull for a Phisition to trye. Yet let this suffice to haue spoken in this present, that if wine (for example) be mingled with water, the partes of both these are scattered into the smallest, and by &amp; by, they doe mutually doe and suffer togeather, and so much the easier they do communicate the qualities mutuallye vntill they be brought into lesse through longer mouing and mingling. For in time of necessity the partes of those thinges which are mutually mingled will exactly worke vpon them selues, and exactly suffer, and so all that wilbe one, and on euerye parte like it selfe.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herefore as hote, drye, cold, and moiste are the common Elementes, beginners of all thinges, so Blood, Flegme, &amp; blacke Coler and Yelow are the proper Elements or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thinges endewed with blood. But proper to men be the similar particles, although these be c≈çmon to many endewed with blood, as Oxe, Dogge, and Horse, yet not like to men. But ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly that the partes of all Creatures hauing blood be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of their mother blood, it is euident inough, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che s√©eing it is partaker of Flegme, and also of other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler it is shewed, by which reason <hi>Hipp.</hi> perswaded, hath taught that the foure humors be the matter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender man. Furthermore, Fleshe and Sinowes b√©e partes similar or simple, and s√©eing the Fleshe is Blood, and beside softe and hote, but the Sinowe without blood, hard &amp; cold, and also other parts haue other differences. It s√©emeth agr√©eable vnto reason, that wise nature at what time shee framed the issue or infant of the mothers blood to haue drawen that which was thicker to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute sounder bodies, that which was thinner to the sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that which was hotter to the hotter, that which was colder to the colder.</p>
            <p>And in the time folowing, that euery one of the parts fourmed had his proper Eliment or nourishment, and encrease, of proper and particuler matter, for euen as in Milke there is founde both milke, and also a certaine ch√©esie substaunce, so in blood you may finde a certaine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27230:10"/> thinne liquour much like the whea of blood, and also as it were a certaine mudde and beside, the fibres which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the blood, as the blood shall no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, so also it shall in colour b√©e varied, wherevppon the blood is not simple. Otherwise it shoulde be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies like both in men and beastes. But by experience w√©e maye knowe the contrarye, bothe of the varietye of colours, and especially of thinges which are euacuated by purging Medicines. Whiche truely if they be well ministred, they wyll drawe vnto them according to the differences of sicknesses iuyces perticular and differing. Against whiche <hi>Asclepiades</hi> endeuoureth to perswade, that is, that the medicines doe not drawe vnto the familiar iuyces, but to chaunge and to corrupt them, and to alter them into theyr owne nature, which truely as they b√©e most absurde, so those thinges which daylye we s√©e done by immoderate purgations, doe shewe most euidentlye howe euery medicine doeth drawe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per humors. If so be that as often as any man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued a medicine which hath power to clense choler, first it shal expel such humor, by vomitte, after Flegme, then blacke choler, lastly pure blood, which being euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, the soule departeth. If you giue a medicine dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Flegme, that shall first b√©e emptied, then Yelowe coler, because, it is easie to be brought forth, after blacke very stubburne and resistyng. And laste of all blood is alway brought foorth because it is set very n√©ere nature.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when that first humor is euacuated, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creature cannot then b√©e in health, when it hath loste one of his Elementes, but it is altogeather dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and perisheth. And then out of the rest there floweth humor which is more fit to b√©e clensed, because there is a certaine naturall power to euery thing to draw those thinges which be conuenient for it. As in the Loade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone there is force to drawe vnto it Yron. And through this facultye, both nourishmentes and euacuations are
<pb facs="tcp:27230:11"/> made, it drawing alwayes that which is expedient, yet often with this, something which is not expedient, so that sometime it commeth in vse to haue purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which truely when they haue drawen that flegme or coler which doeth abounde, they catche vnto them some peculiar humor of the sounde partes, by a certaine force and dissoluing, and melting them, and bringing them to Elements, and committing the creature to death, and another certaine humor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the violence of this attraction of affinitye vnto it, which first was drawen by force.</p>
